# automatic-google-login
Purpose: I wanted to keep manual-browser. Basically using Selenium library makes browser automatic window, where you can't use add-on.
so I came up with the creation.
Regarding the program, you have to download pyautogui from PIP or some software packages since it uses mouse-gesture. Add both google IDs and passwords you want to keep in the program where there are lists.

Coution:
In case you use JP keybord, you have to press ”英数”　button first. this program copys mouse gesture and manual-input, so if your keybord were "かな" version, IDS and passwords are inputed in Japanese.
